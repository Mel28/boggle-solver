<h1> Boggle Solver </h1>
<p> Hello, this boggle solver was created as part of my course work through the code institute.</p>
<p> The boggle solver was created using a test driven environment, by creating tests first then writing code to make them pass.
</n> The algorithms created were made more efficient by understanding and using appropriate data structures and collections along
</n> with the use of recursion. I used profiling to investigate why some of the code was running slower than usual and adjusted
</n> the code appropriately. </P>
